We adults do not commonly understand boys.
 Half of us, to be sure, were boys ourselves;
 but when we became men and settled down to our work, we did not merely put away childish things¡ªwe went further and forgot them.
 To-day, we read a story of boy life and we say, ¡°Why, yes. That¡¯s just the way boys do. I used to do exactly that sort of thing myself.¡±
 But the next hour we have forgotten again, and the boy we were is once more a stranger. Boyville is so far removed, both from Delos and from Babylon, that we seldom think the thoughts of its inhabitants, nor see the world with the boys¡¯ eyes. Only a few men are at home in both worlds,¡ªLindsay, George, some schoolmasters, an occasional father,¡ªand these can do anything with a boy.
2 The difficulty seems not so much to be that we have forgotten the incidents of our boyhood as that we have lost its feelings. So far as specific doings are concerned, 
we probably remember those crowded years more distinctly than any equal period of our entire lives. Most of us, too, remember them happily, as happily probably as any years we have lived. No
, the trouble is not with the memory, but with the self. The experiences of life since we were boys have shifted our psychic centre of gravity, 
so that we realize the particular incident far more easily than we realize the being to whom it occurred. We do not completely feel that the boy that was is quite ourselves; and while the memory of the fact is sharp, 
the memory of the mental state that went with it has become dim.
 Therefore, it costs a distinct effort to put one¡¯s self in the boy¡¯s place. Any proper man will recite by the hour tales of the old swimming-hole in the summer. But if men actually felt toward the water as boys do,
 every club and half the private houses would have a swimming tank instead of a smoking room.
